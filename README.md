# PythonProjects
	Followed Alex The Analyst's videos on YouTube to learn these projects.
	The BMI Calculator asks for the user's name, height, and weight, calculates their BMI, and then tells them based on the calculation if they are normal or above weight. (I personally am not a fan of the BMI, as it does not take in other factors that might affect someone's weight, like age or sex, so please take what the calculation says with a grain of salt.)
	The File Sorter Project reads a path for a folder on the user's computer and then creates folders for Text, Image, CSV, and Python. Once the folders are created, it then sorts the files in the original folder into their respective folders. 
	The Web Scraping Project takes in a website, reads the HTML, finds the information in the first table then creates a CSV file with the information.
